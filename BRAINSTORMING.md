# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Generate 5 concrete build tasks from open directives**: Prevent queue starvation by pre-decomposing directive work

- **Add staleness detection for BRIEFING.md references**: Scan BRIEFING.md for outdated references (stale URLs, retired files, wrong platform status) and flag them automatically in pre-hooks
