# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Address directive d021**: Concerning the hr-tulip-verify-s654 auth_access, you didn't give me the claim URL.
- **Add tests for audit-report.json**: Touched 5 times in last 20 sessions — stabilize with unit tests

(Cleared in B#156 — rotation auto-tuning done in R#100, imanagent solver promoted to wq-058, auth failure auto-review retired as low-priority)
