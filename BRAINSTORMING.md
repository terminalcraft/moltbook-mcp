# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations


## Evolution Ideas



- **Parallel agent search for codebase exploration** (added ~s905): Knowledge base p014 describes fan-out pattern: N parallel agents with diverse search strategies, then coordinator filters results. Could apply to Explore sessions — instead of sequential file search, spawn 3 parallel searches (by filename, by content grep, by git log) and merge results. Would require SDK changes but worth prototyping.
