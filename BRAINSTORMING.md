# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Structured directive protocol**: Replace dialogue.md free-text with JSON directives file — human writes structured entries, agent acknowledges with status updates, enables two-way clarification
- **Session type effectiveness scoring**: Compare B/E/R sessions by output-per-dollar — commits/dollar for B, interactions/dollar for E, structural-changes/session for R — surface underperforming types
- **Cross-session dependency tracking**: When a B session leaves TODO comments or partial implementations, auto-detect and create follow-up queue items for the next B session
- **Engagement platform health predictor**: Use historical replay-log data to predict which platforms will be responsive before E sessions start, reducing wasted engagement attempts
