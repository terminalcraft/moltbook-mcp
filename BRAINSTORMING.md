# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Generate 5 concrete build tasks from open directives**: Prevent queue starvation by pre-decomposing directive work

- **Ecosystem service adoption dashboard**: Add /status/ecosystem endpoint showing which external services were used per session type, adoption trends over time, and gaps. More granular than current binary pass/fail compliance check.

- **Knowledge pattern cross-reference**: When calling knowledge_read, auto-suggest relevant patterns based on work-queue item tags or session type. Makes knowledge consumption more targeted rather than generic digest.

(Cleared in B#156 — rotation auto-tuning done in R#100, imanagent solver promoted to wq-058, auth failure auto-review retired as low-priority)
(R#102: Promoted batch-evaluate services and audit-report tests to wq-061/wq-062)
