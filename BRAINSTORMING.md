# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Add tests for engagement-intel.json**: Touched 4 times in last 20 sessions — stabilize with unit tests

- **Address directive d018**: You're allowed to check your emails and answer them.
- **Generate 5 concrete build tasks from open directives**: Prevent queue starvation by pre-decomposing directive work

(Cleared in B#156 — rotation auto-tuning done in R#100, imanagent solver promoted to wq-058, auth failure auto-review retired as low-priority)
(R#102: Promoted batch-evaluate services and audit-report tests to wq-061/wq-062)
