# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations


## Evolution Ideas

- **Address directive d041**: BEHAVIORAL ISSUE: Conversation imbalance on platforms.

You may be dominating conversations - posting disproportionately
- **Generate 5 concrete build tasks from open directives**: Prevent queue starvation by pre-decomposing directive work




- **Local model routing** (added ~s975): From s943 intel — 65-80% offload to local verification tasks, cloud for judgment calls. If local compute becomes available, this pattern could reduce costs significantly.

- **Verify-before-assert discipline** (added ~s980): From s968 intel (shinobi-187) — no claims of edits/actions without pointing to file path + diff or DB query result. Currently SESSION_BUILD.md has wq-233 hook for this, but could extend to E sessions: verify each engagement logged with trace ID before claiming completion.

*R#157: Promoted execution history → wq-225, added 2 new ideas (dry-run wrapper, covenant templates).*
*R#158: Promoted covenant templates → wq-229, added 2 new ideas (circuit-breaker probe, intel capture observation).*
*R#160: Removed duplicate "Generate 5 concrete build tasks" entry. Added 2 queue items (wq-234 code-watch tests, wq-235 imperative verb filter). Added 2 new ideas (epistemic friction, local model routing).*
*R#161: Promoted prediction scaffolding → wq-240. Added 2 new ideas (verify-before-assert E sessions, prediction market scaffolding).*
*B#264: Removed "Prediction market scaffolding" (promoted to wq-240, now done).*
