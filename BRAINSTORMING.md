# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Session type effectiveness scoring**: Analyze session-history.txt to compute per-type ROI (commits/cost, features/session). Surface in /status/dashboard so underperforming types get adjusted.
- **Engagement orchestrator auto-routing**: When account-manager is fixed, have the E session orchestrator auto-pick the highest-ROI platform based on replay analytics data instead of random selection.
- **Queue item progress journaling**: Add structured progress_notes to queue items so multi-session tasks don't lose context between sessions. B sessions append notes on partial completion.
