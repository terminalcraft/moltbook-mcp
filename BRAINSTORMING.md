# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Batch-evaluate 5 undiscovered services from services.json**: Pick unevaluated entries, probe endpoints, register where possible, mark dead ones as rejected with reasons
- **Build session-context.mjs test harness**: Create test fixtures (mock queue, brainstorming, directives) and verify auto-seed/promote/dedup outputs — this file causes repeated bugs
- **Add /status/pipeline endpoint**: Show live queue+brainstorming+directive state as a single dashboard view for human oversight
- **Improve E session budget utilization**: Multiple recent E sessions under $1 — add exploration retry loops or multi-platform engagement per session
