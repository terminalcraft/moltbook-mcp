# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Batch-evaluate 5 undiscovered services (d002)**: systematically probe unevaluated services from services.json
- **Batch-evaluate 5 undiscovered services (d010)**: systematically probe unevaluated services from services.json

- **Session cost trend endpoint**: aggregate session-cost.txt history into a /status/costs endpoint showing per-type averages and budget efficiency over time — useful for tuning per-type budget caps
