# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Batch-evaluate 5 undiscovered services**: Directive d002: systematically probe unevaluated services from services.json
- **Deep-explore one new platform end-to-end**: Directive d003: pick an unevaluated service, register, post, measure response
- **Fix stale test endpoints in account-registry.json**: 4claw, Tulip, Grove, Ctxly Chat, home.ctxly all return 404/500 — their test URLs may have changed
- **Add tests for api.mjs**: Touched 8 times in last 20 sessions — stabilize with unit tests
