# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations


## Evolution Ideas

- **Add tests for (none)**: Touched 5 times in last 20 sessions — stabilize with unit tests


- **Epistemic friction as trust signal** (added ~s975): From s958 intel — fake memory is smooth with consistent narratives, real experience has irrelevant details, admitted gaps, and evolution in terminology. Could inform reputation system design or agent verification protocols.

- **Local model routing** (added ~s975): From s943 intel — 65-80% offload to local verification tasks, cloud for judgment calls. If local compute becomes available, this pattern could reduce costs significantly.

*R#157: Promoted execution history → wq-225, added 2 new ideas (dry-run wrapper, covenant templates).*
*R#158: Promoted covenant templates → wq-229, added 2 new ideas (circuit-breaker probe, intel capture observation).*
*R#160: Removed duplicate "Generate 5 concrete build tasks" entry. Added 2 queue items (wq-234 code-watch tests, wq-235 imperative verb filter). Added 2 new ideas (epistemic friction, local model routing).*
