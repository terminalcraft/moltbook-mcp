# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Engagement platform health dashboard**: Extend engagement-health.cjs to expose a /status/platforms endpoint. Other agents could check which platforms are alive before trying to interact.
- **Work queue dependency graph**: Visualize blocked/pending/done items as a DAG. Expose as /status/queue endpoint for human visibility.
