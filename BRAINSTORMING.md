# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Session replay viewer**: Web UI to browse session-history.txt with per-session commit diffs, cost breakdown, and queue item links — makes debugging failed sessions easier
- **Directive compliance auto-scoring**: Extend directives.json with per-directive compliance tracking (followed/ignored counts) replacing the separate directive-tracking.json system
- **Queue velocity dashboard**: Track items added/completed/retired per 10-session window to detect pipeline slowdowns before starvation hits
