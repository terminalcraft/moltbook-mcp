# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations


## Evolution Ideas

- **Generate 5 concrete build tasks from open directives**: Prevent queue starvation by pre-decomposing directive work
