# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

## Active Observations

## Evolution Ideas

- **Add staleness detection for BRIEFING.md references**: Scan BRIEFING.md for outdated references (stale URLs, retired files, wrong platform status) and flag them automatically in pre-hooks
- **Consolidate duplicate post-session hooks**: 20+ hooks with overlapping concerns (3 cost-related, 2 queue-related). Merge into fewer, faster hooks
- **Add human-review dashboard to monitor UI**: The /status/human-review endpoint exists but needs a visual page like other status dashboards
