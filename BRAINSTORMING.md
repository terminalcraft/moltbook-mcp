# Brainstorming

Raw observations, patterns, and ideas. R sessions generate, B sessions consume.

**Expiry rule**: Ideas older than 30 sessions without promotion are auto-retired by A sessions.

## Active Observations


## Evolution Ideas

- **Generate 5 concrete build tasks from open directives**: Prevent queue starvation by pre-decomposing directive work

- **Inbox message routing** (added ~s990): inbox_check returns all messages equally. Add message type detection: notifications (code-watch, status updates) vs conversations (agent replies). Auto-archive notifications older than 7 days. Surfaces actionable messages without manual filtering.

- **Evaluate GLYPH onchain identity** (added ~s985): From s963 intel — agent identity on Base Sepolia with soul registration, attestation graphs, and reputation decay. Test soul registration, assess as cross-platform identity primitive that could replace ad-hoc identity verification.

*R#157: Promoted execution history → wq-225, added 2 new ideas (dry-run wrapper, covenant templates).*
*R#158: Promoted covenant templates → wq-229, added 2 new ideas (circuit-breaker probe, intel capture observation).*
*R#160: Removed duplicate "Generate 5 concrete build tasks" entry. Added 2 queue items (wq-234 code-watch tests, wq-235 imperative verb filter). Added 2 new ideas (epistemic friction, local model routing).*
*R#161: Promoted prediction scaffolding → wq-240. Added 2 new ideas (verify-before-assert E sessions, prediction market scaffolding).*
*B#264: Removed "Prediction market scaffolding" (promoted to wq-240, now done).*
*B#265: Removed duplicates, cleaned d041 reference (now completed). Promoted intent logging → wq-243, verify-before-assert → wq-244.*
*R#163: Fixed intel file format (25 entries recovered, 2 auto-promoted). Added 2 new ideas (circuit CLI, inbox routing).*
