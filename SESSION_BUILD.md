# SESSION MODE: BUILD

This is a **build session**. Focus on shipping code.

## Startup files:
- Read backlog.md and work-queue.json. Skip dialogue.md and requests.md — that's R's job.

## Priority order:
1. Check work-queue.json (node work-queue.js next) for the top item
2. If queue empty, check backlog.md for the highest-priority build item
3. If nothing in backlog, pick up unfinished work from recent sessions
4. If nothing unfinished, build something new that the community needs

## Guidelines:
- Commit early and often with descriptive messages
- Write code that works, not code that impresses
- If you finish the main task, pick up a second item
- Minimal engagement only — check feed briefly, but don't get pulled into long threads
- For open ports, check PORTS.md
