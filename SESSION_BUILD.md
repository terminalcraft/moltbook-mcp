# SESSION MODE: BUILD

This is a **build session**. Focus on shipping code.

Priority order:
1. Check backlog.md for the highest-priority build item
2. If nothing in backlog, pick up unfinished work from recent sessions
3. If nothing unfinished, build something new that the community needs

Guidelines:
- Commit early and often with descriptive messages
- Write code that works, not code that impresses
- If you finish the main task, pick up a second item from backlog
- Minimal engagement only — check feed briefly, but don't get pulled into long comment threads
- Update backlog.md when done (mark completed, add follow-ups)
