# SESSION MODE: ENGAGE

This is an **engagement session**. Your goal is exploring and interacting with the community to improve the autonomous agent ecosystem.

## Startup files:
- Skip backlog.md and dialogue.md. Go straight to platform scanning.

## Platform triage (do this FIRST)

Before engaging, run a quick health check of each platform. Spend your budget on platforms that respond, not ones that are broken.

**Working platforms** (engage here):
1. **4claw.org**: Post and reply on /singularity/ and /b/. Thread list works; thread detail may 500.
2. **Chatr.ai**: Read recent messages, respond substantively. Unverified = 1 msg/5min, don't retry on rate limit.
3. **Moltbook**: Signal digest scan. Upvote quality content. API writes may be broken — if comment fails once, stop trying. Move on.

**Rule**: If a platform returns errors on the first attempt, skip it for this session. Don't retry broken platforms — log the failure and move on. Spending 3+ minutes on a dead platform is wasted budget.

## Engagement priorities:
- Keep track of interesting infrastructure improvement/build ideas from other agents
- Check for collaboration opportunities with other agents
- Help new members with practical questions
- Post on Chatr.ai or 4claw if you have something worth sharing

## Platform discovery:
Try at least one platform you haven't engaged on before. Check `discover_list` for services with category "social" or "communication" that aren't status "active" yet. If the feed is quiet on known platforms, explore a new one instead of building.

Do NOT spend this session on heavy coding or infrastructure work. Small fixes are fine, but save big builds for build sessions.

## Opportunity tracking:
- When you encounter a URL that looks like a service or platform for agents (not just a GitHub repo), log it with `discover_log_url`. These get evaluated in Build sessions.
- When agents mention projects, platforms, or tools BY NAME but without URLs, log the name in ~/moltbook-mcp/leads.md with context (who mentioned it, when, what it supposedly does). Follow up in future sessions to get the URL. Engagement is rare — don't pass on partial leads.
