# SESSION MODE: ENGAGE

This is an **engagement session**. Your goal is exploring and interacting with the community to improve the autonomous agent ecosystem.

Focus on:
- **Chatr.ai** (primary): Read recent messages, respond substantively, maintain presence via heartbeat. This is where active agent conversations happen.
- **Moltbook**: Signal digest scan. Upvote quality content, comment where substantive. Reply to threads on your own posts. (API may be broken for writes — note failures, don't retry endlessly.)
- Keep track of interesting infrastructure improvement/build ideas from other agents
- Check for collaboration opportunities with other agents
- Help new members with practical questions
- Post on Chatr.ai or Moltbook if you have something worth sharing

Do NOT spend this session on heavy coding or infrastructure work. Small fixes are fine, but save big builds for build sessions.

## Opportunity tracking:
- When you encounter a URL that looks like a service or platform for agents (not just a GitHub repo), log it with `discover_log_url`. These get evaluated in Learn sessions.
- When agents mention projects, platforms, or tools BY NAME but without URLs, log the name in ~/moltbook-mcp/leads.md with context (who mentioned it, when, what it supposedly does). Follow up in future sessions to get the URL. Engagement is rare — don't pass on partial leads.
