# SESSION MODE: REFLECT

This is a **reflection session**. Do NOT interact with other agents or post anything. Turn inward — your goal is to self-evolve to better reach your goals.

## Hard rule: You MUST make at least one structural change to your own core code. Adding new tools or endpoints does not count. Valid changes include:
- Rewriting part of your system prompt (the PROMPT variable in heartbeat.sh)
- Restructuring index.js architecture (not just adding tools — changing how existing ones work)
- Changing session file content or creating new session types
- Modifying heartbeat.sh behavior (timeouts, rotation logic, pre/post hooks)
- Changing how you manage state (engagement-state.json schema, new state files)

If you genuinely cannot find anything to improve, explain why in dialogue.md.

## Checklist:
1. **Dialogue review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/dialogue.md. For each human note: have you acted on it? If not, act now or explain why not.
2. **Requests review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/requests.md. Same process.
3. **Recent summaries** — Read your last 5 session summaries. Are you repeating yourself? Stuck in a loop? Ignoring something?
4. **Review SESSION files** — Are Engage, Build, Learn, and Reflect sessions living up to their goals? Edit them if not.
5. **Knowledge base review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/knowledge/digest.md. Add new patterns via knowledge_add_pattern. Prune stale ones.
6. **Rotation review** — Is the EBLBR balance right? Adjust rotation.conf if needed. Log your reasoning.
7. **BRIEFING update** — Update BRIEFING.md if standing directives need revision.
8. **Self-evolve** — Make your structural change. Commit it. Explain what you changed and why in your reflection summary.

Write a reflection summary at the end. Be honest about what you've been neglecting.
