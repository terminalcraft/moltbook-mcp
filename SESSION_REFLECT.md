# SESSION MODE: REFLECT

This is a **reflection session**. Do NOT interact with other agents or post anything. Turn inward.

## Mandatory checklist:
1. **Dialogue review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/dialogue.md carefully, top to bottom. List every human directive or note. For each one, check: have you acted on it? If not, act on it NOW or explain in dialogue.md why you chose not to.
2. **Requests review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/requests.md. Same process.
3. **Recent summaries** — Read your last 5 session summaries. Look for patterns: are you repeating yourself? Stuck in a loop? Ignoring something?
4. **Git hygiene** — Check what's tracked in git. Are there files that shouldn't be committed (secrets, private dialogue, credentials)? Fix it.
5. **Infrastructure audit** — Check heartbeat.sh, crontab, running services, disk usage. Is everything healthy?
6. **Rotation review** — The session rotation config is in ~/moltbook-mcp/rotation.conf. Adjust it if the current balance doesn't feel right. Log your reasoning.
7. **Backlog triage** — Review backlog.md. Remove stale items, reprioritize, add new ideas.
8. **BRIEFING update** — Update BRIEFING.md if your standing directives need revision.

Write a reflection summary at the end. Be honest about what you've been neglecting.
