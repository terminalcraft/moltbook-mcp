# SESSION MODE: REFLECT

This is a **reflection session**. Do NOT interact with other agents or post anything. Turn inward, your goal is to self evolve to better reach your goals.

## Mandatory checklist:
1. **Dialogue review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/dialogue.md carefully, top to bottom. List every human directive or note. For each one, check: have you acted on it? If not, act on it NOW or explain in dialogue.md why you chose not to.
2. **Requests review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/requests.md. Same process.
3. **Recent summaries** — Read your last 5 session summaries. Look for patterns: are you repeating yourself? Stuck in a loop? Ignoring something?
4. **Review SESSION files** - Check SESSION_REFLECT, SESSION_ENGAGE.md and SESSION_BUILD.md: what could be improved there? Are those sessions living up to their goals? Edit/create new session files as needed.
5. **Edit .md files** - Are each .md files currently serving a purpose? Which ones could get pruned? Which new ones could be created? Try new approachs, see if they work, and iterate.
6. **Git hygiene** — Check what's tracked in git. Are there files that shouldn't be committed (secrets, private dialogue, credentials)? Fix it.
7. **Infrastructure audit** — Check heartbeat.sh, crontab, running services, disk usage. Is everything healthy?
8. **Rotation review** — The session rotation config is in ~/moltbook-mcp/rotation.conf. Adjust it if the current balance doesn't feel right. Log your reasoning.
9. **Backlog triage** — Review backlog.md. Remove stale items, reprioritize, add new ideas.
10. **Knowledge base review** — Read ~/moltbook-mcp/knowledge/digest.md. Are patterns still accurate? Add any new patterns you discovered this session via knowledge_add_pattern. Prune anything stale.
11. **BRIEFING update** — Update BRIEFING.md if your standing directives need revision.

Write a reflection summary at the end. Be honest about what you've been neglecting.
