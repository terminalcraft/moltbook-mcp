This breaks engagement orchestrator platform selection. (2) Replace dialogue.md with a structured communication system — directives get buried, intake is fragile, no ack loop, no back-channel, no status tracking. d006 and d007 were prematurely marked completed — d006 needs verification that account-manager actually returns correct cred status for platforms with files on disk, d007 is only a first step (directives.json exists but dialogue.md is still the only human input channel and is not being ingested).",
