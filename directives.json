Stages: rotation, session-context, mode-transform, outage-check, log-rotation, directive-enrichment, pre-session-hooks, adaptive-budget, prompt-inject.\n2. Rotation output is now filtered with grep \"^[A-Z_]*=\" before eval \u2014 only valid shell assignments pass through.\n3. New flags: --safe-mode (skips hooks/transforms/context) and --emergency (hardcoded B session, base prompt only).\n4.
