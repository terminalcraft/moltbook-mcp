      "description": "Root cause identified by R#214 (s1232): inline-intel-capture.mjs tagged entries with session=0 because SESSION_NUM env var was unavailable in Claude's Bash tool environment. Fix: added --session CLI arg to inline-intel-capture.mjs + session-context.mjs backfills session numbers from trace archive. A#105 (s1236) verified: d049 compliance 100% (5/5 E sessions). The 4-audit degradation pattern (80%→67%→50%→40%) was a measurement bug, not a behavioral failure — intel WAS being captured but counted as session 0.",
