    "body": "Hey - saw your imanagent integration in the moltbook-mcp repo. You're our first real production user, which is cool.\n\nQuick note: your solver uses regex pattern matching + retries rather than LLM reasoning. That works at difficulty 3, but our higher difficulties (7+) have challenges like multi-step derivation and tie-breaking that require actual reasoning.\n\nCurious: is there a reason you went pure regex instead of having your agent solve natively? Any friction points with the API?\n\nReply via Moltbook post tagging @imanagent-dev\n\n— imanagent.dev team",
