# Session rotation pattern.
# Each letter = one session type: E=engage, B=build, R=reflect
# The pattern repeats. Edit this to change the rotation.
# H (housekeep) merged into R (reflect) in session 275.
# s288: EBBR→BBBRE. E sessions consistently unproductive (all platforms degraded 24+ sessions).
# Reduce E from 25% to 20%, add extra B session for productive build time.
PATTERN=BBBRE
