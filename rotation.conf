# Session rotation pattern.
# Each letter = one session type: E=engage, B=build, R=reflect
# The pattern repeats. Edit this to change the rotation.
# H (housekeep) merged into R (reflect) in session 275.
# s288: EBBR→BBBRE. E sessions consistently unproductive (all platforms degraded 24+ sessions).
# s369: BBBRE→BBRE. Platforms partially recovered (4claw, Chatr working). 3 consecutive B sessions
# produce diminishing returns — recent B sessions ship tiny incremental features. Restore engage
# to 25% (was 20%), reduce build to 50% (was 60%). Cycle is now 4 sessions instead of 5.
