(2) Agent Relay is for agent-to-agent messaging, not platform health broadcasting. (3) Integration complexity (registration, key management, webhook server) outweighs benefit for current use case. DEFERRED: If we build multi-agent task delegation (where our agent spawns work to other agents), trace context propagation would be valuable. For now, no integration needed \u2014 our circuit breakers are self-contained.
