Root cause: enforcement hooks are post-session (reactive), so they detect violations but cannot prevent them. E sessions engage platforms but skip intel extraction. R session must redesign: (1) Move intel capture to an inline phase during engagement rather than post-engagement, (2) Consider a pre-completion gate that blocks session end if 0 intel, (3) Simplify intel format to reduce capture overhead. This is structural — needs R session architectural redesign, not another enforcement hook.",
