      "description": "3 external python3 scripts remain in heartbeat.sh: directive-enrichment.py, adaptive-budget.py, summarize-session.py. R#283 eliminated the inline python3 call (prompt-inject JSON extraction → jq). Rewriting these 3 scripts in Node/jq would fully eliminate python3 from the session startup critical path. Each is a standalone script: (1) directive-enrichment.py cross-references directives with work-queue to produce enrichment JSON — straightforward jq or node rewrite; (2) adaptive-budget.py computes session budgets from cost history — simple math, good jq candidate; (3) summarize-session.py is the emergency summary generator — most complex, may need node. Tackle one per B session.",
