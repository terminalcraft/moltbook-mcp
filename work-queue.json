Status lifecycle: pending → in-progress → done | blocked | retired. Blocked items may have a blocker_check (shell command) — heartbeat.sh runs it before B sessions and auto-promotes to pending on exit 0. Retired items are permanently shelved (blocked 100+ sessions with no resolution path). Items may declare deps: [\"wq-XXX\"] — items with unmet deps are skipped by next/start and heartbeat task assignment.",
